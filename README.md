## Predictive Gaussian Splat (PGS) for End-to-End Robot Manipulation

## Installation with single line
```bash
pixi r build
```

## Usage
activate the environment
```bash
pixi shell
```
### Calibrate wrist mounted and third person cameras
Before training/tracking POGS, make sure wrist mounted camera and third-person view camera are calibrated. We use an Aruco marker for the calibration
```bash
cd src/pogs/scripts
python calibrate_cameras.py
```
### Rekep
Run Rekep and get path
```bash
pixi r rekep
```

### Scene Capture
We used manual trajectory, you can capture trajectory at calibrate_cameras.py.
```bash
python src/pogs/scripts/scene_capture.py --scene box
```

### Train POGS
Script used to train the POGS for 3000 steps
```bash
ns-train pogs --data src/pogs/data/utils/datasets/box
```
Once the POGS has completed training, there are N steps to then actually define/save the object clusters.
1. Hit the cluster scene button.
2. It will take 10-20 seconds, but then after, you should see your objects as specific clusters. If not, hit Toggle RGB/Cluster and try to cluster the scene again but change the Cluster Eps (lower normally works better).
3. Once you have your scene clustered, hit Toggle RGB/Cluster.
4. Then, hit Click and click on your desired object (green ball will appear on object).
5. Hit Crop to Click, and it should isolate the object.
6. A draggable coordinate frame will pop up to indicate the object's origin, drag it to where you want it to be. (For experiments, this was what we used to align for object reset or tool servoing)
7. Hit Add Crop to Group List
8. Repeat steps 4-7 for all objects in scene
9. Hit View Crop Group List
Once you have trained the POGS, make sure you have the config file and checkpoint directory from the terminal saved.

### View Gsplat
```bash
ns-viewer --load-config outputs/box/pogs/2025-09-09_143905/config.yml --viewer.websocket-port 8007
```

### Output filtered end pose
```bash
python scripts/sample_and_filter_poses.py
```

### Run Bi-RRT to get path
```bash
python scripts/BiRRT_Cons.py
```

### Visualize animation that equal to action
```bash
python scripts/generate_action_animation.py
```

### Execute on UR5
```bash
python scripts/execute_subgoals.py
```

### Cycle execute UR5
```bash
python scripts/cyclic_execute_subgoals.py
```
